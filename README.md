# IncrementalMRI

Work in progress version of the code of "Incremental Undersampling MRI Acquisition with Neural Self Assessment"

The old version of the code, that works but it is really bad coded, is a collection of files "results" and "cli".
A new work in progress version of the code, that is not ready yet, is mainly contained in the "work_in_progress" file.
